# Predicting Apartment Pricing in Daegu

## Business Problem Understanding
***Context***

A business is selling apartments in Daegu, a city in South Korea. As one of the urban areas in the nation, the demand for housing is high. At the same time, the city has limited residential land, making apartments one of the solutions. This makes analyzing apartment prices, influenced by various internal and external factors, a topic of great interest.

Apartment units are typically offered by individual owners or companies, who list them on platforms and set their own prices. However, adjusting these prices to match market conditions can be challenging. Overpricing may lead to difficulty in securing buyers, while underpricing can result in reduced profits for the seller.

Target: Sale Price



***Problem Statement***

Management is searching for the best way to predict sale prices, as this is essential for maximizing their profit. If they overprice the apartments, they risk losing customers, while underpricing could reduce their profit potential.

Currently, management has a method to predict apartment sale prices, but it is considered too simplistic for handling large datasets. They have been predicting apartment prices using rule-based model based on the median for each hallway type (terraced, mixed, and corridor). The median prices are 275,840 won for terraced, 155,799 won for mixed, and 87,968 won for corridor apartments.

Therefore, the problem statements are as follows:

1. What factors influence apartment pricing in Daegu?
2. What is the best model for predicting apartment prices, and how does this model forecast pricing in Daegu?
3. How can the business benefit from the model?



***Analytic Approach***

Management plan to build a best model to predict apartment pricing in Daegu. They plan to use the Machine Learning algorithm. Machine learning operates using models that are driven by algorithms, which can be fully reliant on data. Unlike rule-based algorithms, machine learning is highly scalable with increasing amounts of data. As the algorithm is exposed to more data, it improves its ability to identify key features, leading to enhanced performance (Source:socure.com).

Therefore, I will assist management in developing the best model for predicting apartment prices using a machine learning algorithm. Since this involves predicting apartment prices, it will be approached as a regression problem.


***Metric Evaluation***

The model will be evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. This project will primarily focus on RMSE, as apartment prices vary widely, ranging from lower-end to higher-end units. These price differences are crucial in predicting pricing accurately. RMSE is preferred because it places greater emphasis on larger errors by squaring them before averaging, making it more sensitive to outliers. In this project, large deviations in predicted prices could have significant financial consequences.

## Variable Description
| Variable | Description |
|---- | ---- |
| HallwayType | Type of Apartment (terraced, mixed, and corridor)|
| TimeToSubway | Time needed to the nearest subway station (in range of: 0-5 min; 5-10 min; 10-15 min; 15-20 min; and no_bus_stop_nearby)|
| SubwayStation | The name of the nearest subway station, there are 7 nearest subway and 1 no subway nearby|
| N_FacilitiesNearBy(ETC) | The number of Electronic Tolls Collection facilities nearby (0, 1, 2, and 5) |
| N_FacilitiesNearBy(PublicOffice) | The number of public office facilities nearby (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) |
| N_SchoolNearBy(University) | The number of universities nearby (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) |
| N_Parkinglot(Basement) | The number of the parking lot (0, 18, 56, 76, 79, 108, 181, 184, 203, 218, 400, 475, 524, 536, 605, 798, 930, 1174, 1270, 1321)|
| YearBuilt | The year the apartment was built (1978, 1980, 1985, 1986, 1992, 1993, 1997, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2015)|
| N_FacilitiesInApt | Number of facilities in the apartment (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10)|
| Size(sqf)| The apartment size (in square feet)|
| SalePrice| The apartment price (Won)|

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As we can see from the graph above, SalePrice and Size (sqf) have a positive relationship, where a larger size corresponds to a higher SalePrice. Furthermore, the highest average SalePrice comes from the terraced hallway type, followed by mixed, and then corridor.


## Model Selection

Although the RMSE decreases when outliers are excluded from the data, I chose to retain the original dataset because the outlier SalePrices reflect higher-class apartments. These apartments are generally terraced, situated within 0-5 minutes of the subway, and in proximity to Kyungbuk University Hospital. Excluding the outliers from the data may result in a dataset that is not representative of real-world conditions. For more details on how these elements contribute to elevated Sale Prices, please refer to the EDA section.

The CatBoost model from the feature engineering experiment did not achieve a lower RMSE than the baseline model. Therefore, the best model remains the CatBoost from the baseline model.

## Feature Importance

It has been proven that Size and HallwayType (terraced) are the two most important features in predicting SalePrice, which aligns with the analysis in the EDA. Other significant variables include the number of parking spaces (basement), YearBuilt, the number of facilities in the apartment, Electronic Toll Collection (ETC), proximity to the Kyungbuk University Hospital subway station, the number of public offices, and nearby universities.

These factors significantly influence apartment pricing in Daegu.

## Conclusion
1. The best model for predicting apartment pricing in Daegu is the CatBoost model.
2. The model was optimized using GridSearchCV, resulting in the following best parameter performance: depth: 4, iterations: 300, l2_leaf_reg: 7, learning_rate: 0.1.
3. The model's accuracy is RÂ²: 0.8530 and RMSE: 41,320.
4. The potential benefit of using the CatBoost model is an 18.25% increase in sales, equivalent to over 150 million won.

## Recommendation for Model
The model may not be a good fit for predicting luxury apartments with higher-end pricing, as these apartments could be influenced by additional factors. Therefore, management should investigate other variables that may impact pricing and consider weighing these factors in their predictions. Additionally, the model requires more data to improve its accuracy in predicting higher-end apartments.

## Recommendation for Business
Management could potentially benefit from an 18.25% increase in sales by using the model. The analysis indicates that size is the most important feature in predicting apartment pricing; the **larger the size** of the apartment, the higher its predicted price. Hallway type is also significant, with **terraced types** expected to command higher prices than other types. This relationship is further explored in the EDA section.

Consequently, management should focus on **expanding the size** of apartments and **incorporating terraced hallway** types to boost sales. Additionally, enhancing the **number of basement parking spaces** and available facilities would be beneficial. When constructing apartments, management should consider proximity to the **Kyungbuk University Hospital** subway station, public offices, and nearby universities, as these factors also influence apartment pricing.
